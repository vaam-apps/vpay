# Crash safety

## The invariant

> **Never let a payer act on a transaction you cannot later name.**

Everything below is an application of that one sentence. The two flow shapes
enforce it at different moments, because the payer becomes able to act at
different moments.

## Push rails (MTN MoMo)

MTN acknowledges `requesttopay` with **202 and an empty body**. There is no
transaction id in the response — *the id is the `X-Reference-Id` you sent*.

So the payer's handset starts buzzing before you learn whether your request
succeeded. Generate the reference in memory, call the rail, crash before writing
it down, and you have created a payment you can never observe.

```
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO charges (…, provider_reference_id, state='submitting');
COMMIT;                        -- the reference is now durable
  INSERT INTO provider_requests (…, status_code = NULL);   -- "about to send"
  POST /collection/v1_0/requesttopay   (X-Reference-Id = provider_reference_id)
  UPDATE provider_requests SET status_code = …;            -- "heard back"
UPDATE charges SET state='submitted';
```

**Write first, network second. Always.**

### Retry rule

If submit times out or errors, **do not generate a new reference.** Retry with
the same one. The adapter contract requires a duplicate submission to be
reported as `Submitted` rather than an error — that is what makes this safe. A
fresh reference on retry is how you double-charge a customer.

### Recovering a `submitting` charge

`submitting` covers two physically different situations. Disambiguate with
`provider_requests`:

| Evidence | What happened | Action |
|---|---|---|
| No `provider_requests` row | Crashed before the POST | **Resubmit**, same reference |
| Row exists, `status_code IS NULL` | POST issued, response lost | **Poll**. On `NotFound`, retry the poll; only after 3 consecutive `NotFound` over ≥60s treat it as never-received and resubmit with the same reference |
| Row has a status code | Normal path | Advance state from the code |

A bare `NotFound` is **never** on its own grounds to fail a charge. Resubmission
is always safe, so every ambiguity resolves toward "find out", never "give up".

## Redirect rails (Orange Money)

The ordering is reversed, and it is safe for a reason worth stating plainly.

```
INSERT charge (state='submitting', provider_reference_id = order_id);  COMMIT
POST /webpayment  →  { pay_token, payment_url }
UPDATE charge SET provider_ref_extra = {pay_token…}, state='submitted';  COMMIT
                                     ↑
                    the payer is redirected ONLY after this commit
```

**If the submit response is lost, no payment can have occurred** — the payer was
never given the URL. That `order_id` is dead: abandon it and let the merchant
create a new PaymentIntent. This is the one place where "the response was lost"
is genuinely benign, and it is benign only because the payer's route in is a URL
you must hand them.

What is *not* safe is emitting `redirect_to_url` before `ref_extra` is
committed. Do that and a crash strands a payer mid-payment on the rail's page
against a charge you cannot query.

**The commit is the gate on the redirect.**

## Why Orange is integrable at all

Orange's `transactionstatus` requires `order_id` + `amount` + `pay_token`, and
`pay_token` exists only in the submit response. Under a naive reading of the push
precondition ("status must be queryable by a reference you generated"), that
disqualifies it.

It does not, because of the asymmetry above. This is exactly why the
preconditions are stated **per flow shape** rather than universally.

## Tests

The crash tests kill the worker at three points — after the charge insert and
before any `provider_requests` row; after that row and before the response;
after the response and before the state update — and assert the recovery table
resolves all three without double-charging.

**Status: not implemented.** See [../status.md](../status.md).
